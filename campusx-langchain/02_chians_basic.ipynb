            "\n",
            "1.  **The Longest Cricket Match Lasted 12 Days:** A timeless Test match between England and South Africa in Durban in 1939 went on for 12 days (with a rest day in between). It was eventually declared a draw because the English team had to catch their boat home!\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Cricket Balls Used to be Stuffed with Feathers:**  Early cricket balls, dating back to the 18th century, were literally stuffed with feathers and then covered in leather. This made them unpredictable and likely quite painful to be hit by!\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **The \"Cow Corner\" is Named After Actual Cows:** The fielding position known as \"Cow Corner\" got its name because it was often the area where agricultural workers would graze their cows during village cricket matches.  A shot hit in that direction was considered a risky, agricultural-style slog.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Cricket is the Second Most Popular Sport in the World:**  While it might not be as globally ubiquitous as football (soccer), cricket boasts a massive following, particularly in India, Pakistan, Australia, England, and the West Indies. It's estimated to have over 2.5 billion fans worldwide.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **A \"Duck\" Isn't Named After the Bird:**  The term \"duck\" for a score of zero is believed to have originated from the shape of a duck's egg, which resembles the number zero. Another theory suggests it comes from the phrase \"duck's egg,\" used to describe a bad score in earlier forms of cricket.\n"
